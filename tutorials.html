                <h1 class="container2">How to Cut a Fade</h1>
                <p>In this guide, we are focusing on the fade cut, which we think is the perfect style for beginners. The fade is a popular men’s hairstyle which can cover any kind of cut where the hair is short near the neck and gradually gets longer near
                    the top of the head. Whilst we show you the basics on how to give yourself a fade haircut, make sure you do your research into what specific style you would like. How to Blend Hair with Clippers Start with the sides; do one side and
                    then the other (so you don’t forget what you just did) and then finish off at the back. The lower part of sides is usually slightly shorter. Use a lower number guard around the ears and sideburns. The back is always tricky, so if possible
                    get some help. If you are doing the cut alone use an additional mirror and lay your weaker hand horizontally on the back of your head to prevent you from cutting too high or unevenly Once you are happy with length you can blend with
                    the size above side size and below top size Long Hair Fade This is a really easy method and is suitable for hair at least half a centimetre or quarter of an inch. Slowly lift the clippers after each time you drag through the hair,
                    which will ensure there is no visible line between to sizes. Work slowly and take care for best results.</p>
